# Task Management tool

## This tool is used to manage tasks by arranging them by sorting between ADDED, STARTED and COMPLETED.

- Create task, set priority to task and then click on add button to add task.
- New task gets added in ADDED section.
- Tasks can be Dragged and Dropped onto STARTED and COMPLETED section depending upon status of task.


## Note

We are using React version 17 as we faced bugs using react-beautiful-dnd library (Drag and Drop library) with React 18.

## Available Scripts
